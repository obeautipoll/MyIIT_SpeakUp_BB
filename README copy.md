## Key Features

Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

Modern Aesthetics: Uses the Poppins font and a consistent color palette (Deep Maroon/Red and Gold accents) for a professional look.

Real-Time Data (Placeholder): Designed to handle dynamic content, such as a mock notification count.

Styled Components: Includes custom CSS for table headers, action buttons, status tags, and form inputs for consistency.
